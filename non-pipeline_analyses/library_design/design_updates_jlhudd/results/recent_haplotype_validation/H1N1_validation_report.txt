  Haplotypes with invalid characters: 22 (3.9%)

  Total sequences (valid haplotypes): 1,190
  Total sequences (invalid haplotypes): 120
  Total sequences (all): 1,310

Haplotype Selection:
  Selection columns: ['JohnHuddleston_selections', 'JesseBloom_selections']
  Selected haplotypes: 3 (0.5%)
  Total sequences (selected haplotypes): 18
  ✓ All selected haplotypes have valid sequences

  Invalid characters found: ['-', 'X']

  Examples of haplotypes with invalid characters:
