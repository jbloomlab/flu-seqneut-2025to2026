============================================================

Input file: data/H3N2_haplotypes.tsv

Sequence Length Check:
  All sequences have length: 566
  ✓ All sequences are the same length (properly aligned)

Amino Acid Validity Check:
  Total haplotypes: 601
  Haplotypes with valid amino acids only: 555 (92.3%)
  Haplotypes with invalid characters: 46 (7.7%)

  Total sequences (valid haplotypes): 2,341
  Total sequences (invalid haplotypes): 71
  Total sequences (all): 2,412

Haplotype Selection:
  Selection columns: ['JohnHuddleston_selections', 'JesseBloom_selections']
  Selected haplotypes: 4 (0.7%)
  Total sequences (selected haplotypes): 1,186
  ✓ All selected haplotypes have valid sequences

  Invalid characters found: ['-', 'X']
