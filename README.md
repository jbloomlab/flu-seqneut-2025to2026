# Near real-time data on the human neutralizing antibody landscape to influenza virus in late 2025 to early 2026 to inform vaccine-strain selection in February 2026

Briefly, this study used sequencing-based neutralization assays to measure titers to influenza viruses with HAs from seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 viruses representative of those circulating in late 2025 and early 2026 against a set of human sera collected in mid to late 2025.

## Additional analyses outside the top-level `seqneut-pipeline` snakemake workflow
The subdirectory [./non-pipeline_analyses/](non-pipeline_analyses) has auxillary analyses outside of the main pipeline.
See the README files within that subdirectory for details.
